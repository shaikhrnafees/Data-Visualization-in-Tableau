# Data-Visualization-in-Tableau
In my Tableau data visualization project, I meticulously explored a comprehensive hotel booking dataset, enriching it with diverse insights. Alongside traditional metrics like booking frequencies and customer demographics, I delved into nuanced aspects such as market segments and agent criteria. By segmenting bookings based on market segments and agent criteria, I unveiled hidden patterns and preferences. Furthermore, I dissected hotel trends, analyzing booking ratios year-wise to discern evolving preferences and demand fluctuations. Notably, I conducted a comparative analysis between city hotels and resort hotels, both year-wise and month-wise, revealing differential booking patterns and seasonal trends. These insights empower stakeholders with a holistic understanding of the hospitality landscape, aiding strategic decision-making and targeted interventions.
